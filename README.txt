# WALA
Toys don't grow with children. Educational toys are mostly segmented into age groups to achieve a better effect of learning, 
but this also means that they become useless after the recommended age range. On the other hand, parents now lack time to 
spend with their child. Wala is an educational AI robot with its own mind and has the ability to extend functions with new 
kits the customers buy, similar to Labo for Nintendo's Switch. With the extended functions, the robot can become a 
programmable robot, a race car, or even a music instrument.
