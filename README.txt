# WALA
Toys don't grow with children. Educational toys are mostly segmented into age groups to achieve a better effect of learning, 
but this also means that they become useless after the recommended age range. On the other hand, parents now lack time to 
spend with their child. Wala is an educational AI robot with its own mind and has the ability to extend functions with new 
kits the customers buy, similar to Labo for Nintendo's Switch. With the extended functions, the robot can become a 
programmable robot, a race car, or even a music instrument.

The main idea is to have a toy (hardware) which is fully customizable with respect to physical aspects. 
The customization is achievable by combining different bundles of modular accessories; it is considered a critical aspect because giving 
the toy the possibility to change over time, evolving with kid's tastes, provides the illusion to be a brand new one over and over. 
On top of that, as time goes by, all the different bundles with tell the whole story of your childhood, providing a nostalgia aspect. 
The toy should be able to bond with the kid, talk to him/her and trying to understand what are his/her attitudes and actually promote
activities the kid may like and from which the kid can actually learn something in a fun way. The learning process is left to the
application run on a smartphone/tablet ecc.
